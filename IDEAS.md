A list of things that could be done in no particular order:

* Implementations for additional data types, should be behind feature flags if they pull in additional dependencies
* Support for more advanced obfuscation, such as pointers in vecs etc, will probably require at least a partial rewrite
* Support for using other obfuscation methods than XChaCha8
* Support for arbitrary serializable data
* Optional integrity checks
